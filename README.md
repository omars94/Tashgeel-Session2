## ðŸ§ª Lab Task (Given in Class)
# 
ðŸ§ª ReactJS Lab Task â€“ To-Do List App (with Bugs)
ðŸŽ¯ Objective
You are provided with a scaffolded ReactJS project for a To-Do List App. It contains reusable components and a basic structureâ€”but it has intentional bugs and missing functionality.

Your task is to:

Fix the issues in the code.

Implement full functionality including:

Adding tasks

Viewing pending and completed tasks in separate lists

Reusing a task component for both

ðŸ”§ Features to Implement
 Add a new task using a text input and an "Add" button (Button.jsx - Input.jsx)

 View active tasks in a "To-Do" list (Todolist.jsx)
 
 Text Component for completed Tasks and pending tasks (CustomText.jsx)

 Mark tasks as completed (Checkbox.js)

 Move completed tasks to a separate "Completed" list (Completed.jsx)

 Use a reusable TaskItem component for both to-do and completed tasks (Task.js)

 (Optional Bonus) Delete a task - Toggle Tasks between pending and completed
